# React-Search
This is my first attempt at making a MERN (MongoDB,Express.js,React.js,Node.js) application. 
- MongoDB is used to store selected results after a google books search.
- Express handles the routing, including connecting request to MongoDB
- React is the front-end with the use of Bootstrap
- The applicant is built with Javascript and the back-end uses Node.js

## How the application works:
1. Type in a book title for a book.
2. Hit search. 
3. You will see a list of books.
4. You have the option of saving the book info which you can view in the "saved" page.
